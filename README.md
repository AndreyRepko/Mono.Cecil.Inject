# Mono.Cecil.Inject

## Overview
Mono.Cecil.Inject (Cecil.Inject from now on) is a simple library that adds a few convenience methods to the original Mono.Cecil library.
Added functionality includes method injection, System.Reflection-style methods to search other methods and class members by name and parameters and fast accessibility modification.

The library is almost a seamless addition to Mono.Cecil that should've been in the original library from the beginnig.
The library is compact, easy-to-use and well documented.

## Documentation
As of this moment, no proper documentation is included. Right now the main priority is to write proper documentation for all methods. The PDF version of the documentation will come later.

## Building from source
As of right now, no automatic building scripts are included. To build from source, all you need is Mono.Cecil.
